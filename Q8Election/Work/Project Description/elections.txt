It seems you are trying to manage a complex system of data and interactions, so let’s approach this systematically. The goal is to have a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly UI and UX that minimizes confusion and makes the process smooth and understandable for the users.

### Proposed Structure:

#### 1. **Overview (الملخص)**
   - Display summary information of the election, including total candidates, committees, and campaign statistics.
   - Provide links or buttons to navigate to more detailed sections if users want to dive deeper into each category.

#### 2. **Candidates (المرشحين)**
   - This tab can act as the place where users can add/edit/view details of candidates.
   - Display the list of candidates with their respective final results.
   - Include actionable items like edit, delete for each candidate.

#### 3. **Committees (اللجان)**
   - Allow adding, editing, and deleting of committees.
   - If there is only one committee (TOTAL), streamline the interface to reflect this simplicity.

#### 4. **Campaigns (الحملات الإنتخابية)**
   - Dedicated to the creation, management, and monitoring of campaigns.
   - All campaign-related activities and statuses should be managed here.

#### 5. **Results (النتائج)**
   - Rename “النتائج الكاملة” to just “النتائج” for simplicity.
   - Use this tab for viewing the final results and editing the committee results.
   - If there is only one committee, present a simplified view and editing option, only showing the TOTAL without listing committees.
   - In case of multiple committees, present a detailed breakdown.

#### 6. **User Operations (عمليات المستخدم)**
   - Keep as is, managing user-related actions and information.

#### 7. **Election Management (تعديل)**
   - Keep as the main place for editing election-related details, settings, and configurations.
   - Avoid multiple places for editing to reduce user confusion. Centralize editing functionalities in this section as much as possible.

### Implementation Suggestions:

- Use conditional rendering to adapt the UI based on whether there are multiple committees or just one (TOTAL).
- For results editing, you might create a flexible and intuitive interface where the user can easily switch between committees and update the results, avoiding multiple tabs or sections for editing results.
- Whenever feasible, provide clear instructions or hints in the UI to guide the user through the workflow, especially in parts where they have to make decisions or enter data.

### Conclusion:

Keep the structure simple and user-friendly, centralize editing functionalities, use conditional rendering to adapt the UI to the election’s structure, and provide clear guidance to the users through the interface. This way, you can create a streamlined, intuitive, and efficient experience for the users managing elections in your application.
